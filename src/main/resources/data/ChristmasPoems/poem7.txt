Dear Santa Claus, I'll let you know
The few things that I need,
But if you'll bring them to me
I'll be much obliged indeed.

I want a horse and wagon,
But no boat that's painted red,
No elephant, no jumping-jack-
You need not bring a sled,

For I have one very pretty;
But I want a trotting-horse,
A man who wheels a wheel-barrow,
And candy, too, of course.

Now, Santa dear, you'll not forget.
I wish you'd write them down,
But leave them all at my house
When you journey through the town.
