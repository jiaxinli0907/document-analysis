I had to write a letter
as my mummy said I should
The letter was for Santa clause
to tell him I've been good

So I got a piece of paper
and a pen to take to bed
I sat and started writing
and this is what I said

Hello there Father Christmas
My name is Daisy Payne
I live at Number 53,
At Farmhouse, Country Lane

My mummy said to write to you
to tell you I've been good
and as I do just what I'm told
I thought it's best I should

I didn't want to bother you
but my mummy did insist
So if you think that I've been good
can I please go on your list?

I've really been so good this year
I've helped my mummy lots
I helped her wash the dishes
and the cups and all the pots

I helped her with the shopping
and I helped clean out the bath
I helped her with the washing
and I helped sweep down the path

So there you go dear Santa
I have done what mummy said
its time to say my prayers now
and then I'm off to bed

Thank you so much Santa
that is all I have to say
have a merry Christmas
and a happy holiday
