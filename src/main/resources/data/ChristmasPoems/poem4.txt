Dear Santa, did you get my tweet
of presents I would think are sweet?
And what about my Facebook post
of toys and stuff I want the most?

Dear Santa, did you read my blog?
That's where I keep a running log
of all the times that I've been good
and doing things I know I should.

I hope you saw my Instagram,
my email wasn't flagged as spam,
you've seen my YouTube channel too
and all my texts have made it through.

Wait, does the North Pole even get
computers and the Internet?
I hope it does. I mean, it better,
or I might have to write a letter.
