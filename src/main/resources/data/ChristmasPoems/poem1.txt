I wrote a letter to Santa
To make sure he would know
It's only two weeks until Christmas,
And we still don't have any snow.

Just didn't want his reindeer
To have to work too hard.
I was afraid they might get stuck
In the mud outside in our yard.

I mailed my letter on Monday,
Only two days ago.
As I dropped it in the mailbox,
It slowly started to snow.

It's been snowing ever since,
More as each day goes by.
I'm getting kind of worried now
That Santa will think I lied.

I'll write another letter,
And mail it off today.
Tell Santa not to worry,
There'll be lots of snow for his sleigh.
