Companies look at that and infrastructure.  You have to be able to get your raw materials in and your finished goods out.  Which means good roads/waterways.  Have a good electrical grid.  Good internet.  And have regulations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Low labor cost countries normally don&amp;#39;t have the above.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only reason to do manufacturing in far away places is 2 factors.&lt;br/&gt;\n1.  Cheap labor (which robot revolution will fix).\n2. Cheap Transportation costs.  ( Which drones will fix).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after those 2 items go away the question will be &amp;quot;how much does it cost to keep the robots turned on?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Because Trump can&amp;#39;t be debated on policy. He doesn&amp;#39;t know policy. He lobs insults around left and right, and the only thing left to do is to &amp;quot;one up&amp;quot; him on those insults because that&amp;#39;s what the public wants. She&amp;#39;s in this to win. She&amp;#39;s not in this to be the adult at every step. The public doesn&amp;#39;t reward being an adult. If the public rewarded that then Trump never would have gotten anywhere near where he is. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

He tried to correct Trump on his blatant lies, but he didn&amp;#39;t push the issue too much on Clinton&amp;#39;s email scandal for example. \nHe was most likely under a fuckton of pressure to do both, and let&amp;#39;s be real, Trump has a lot more lies under his belt than Clinton.\nAnyways, I thought he did a decent job. Trump may have been graded on a curve, but much less so than usual in my opinion. Either way - it&amp;#39;s up to the viewer to decide.\nSadly so many of them are just... wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Obviously not all blacks are from Kenya and it&amp;#39;s not really implying anything negative about the person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asking someone to prove they&amp;#39;re American just because they&amp;#39;re  black is definitely racist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asking a candidate you oppose to prove their citizenship after suspicions arise surrounding birth places doesn&amp;#39;t sound inherently racist. If everything was the same and Obama was white, Trump would have still tried to get him disqualified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it a douchy move? Yeah. Is Trump racist? Probably.
